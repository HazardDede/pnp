## pnp.plugins.pull.camera.MotionEyeWatcher

Watches a motioneye directory (where the images and the movies get persisted from motioneye) to trigger some useful events
based on new / modified files. The motion event only works, when the camera is configured to persist images / movies
only when motion is triggered and not 24/7.

For example I use this plugin to publish a binary motion sensor via mqtt discovery to home assistant and upload the
images and videos to dropbox and notify me via pushbullet.

Requires extra `fswatcher`.

__Arguments__

- **path (str)**: The motioneye media directory to watch.
- **image_ext (Optional[str])**: The file extension of your image files. Default is 'jpg'. Deactivate with None.
- **movie_ext (Optional[str])**: The file extension of your movie files. Default is 'mp4'. Deactivate with None.
- **motion_cool_down (Optional[bool])**: Based on created/modified files a motion event might be triggered. After the specified time without motion, the `motion off` event will be triggered.
- **defer_modified (float, optional)**: If set greater than 0, it will defer the sending of modified events for that
    amount of time (seconds). There might be multiple flushes of a file before it is written completely to disk.
    Without defer_modified each flush will raise a modified event. Default is 0.5.

__Result__

Example of a new movie file:

```yaml
{
  event: "movie",
  source: "abs/path/to/the/movie/file.mp4"
}
```

Example of a new image file:

```yaml
{
  event: "image",
  source: "abs/path/to/the/image/file.jpg"
}
```

Example of a new motion on/off event:

```yaml
{
  event: "motion",
  state: "on"  # or "off"
}
```

```

__Authentication__

To request data from the fitbit account it is necessary to create an app. Go to [dev.fitbit.com](dev.fitbit.com).
Under `Manage` go to `Register an App`.
For the application website and organization website, name it anything starting with `http://` or `https://`.
Secondly, make sure the OAuth 2.0 Application Type is `Personal`.
Lastly, make sure the Callback URL is `http://127.0.0.1:8080/` in order to get our Fitbit API to connect properly.
After that, click on the agreement box and submit. You will be redirected to a page that contains your `Client ID` and
your `Client Secret`.

Next we need to acquire your initial `access`- and `refresh`-token.

```
git clone https://github.com/orcasgit/python-fitbit.git
cd python-fitbit
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r dev.txt
./gather_keys_oauth2.py <client_id> <client_secret>
```

You will be redirected to your browser and asked to login to your fitbit account. Next you can restrict the app to
certain data. If everything is fine, your console window should print your `access`- and `refresh`-token and also
`expires_at`.

Put your `client_id`, `client_secret`, `access_token`, `refresh_token` and `expires_at` to a yaml file and use this
file-path as the `config` argument of this plugin. Please see the example below:

```yaml
access_token: <access_token>
client_id: <client_id>
client_secret: <client_secret>
expires_at: <expires_at>
refresh_token: <refresh_token>
```

That's it. If your token expires it will be refreshed automatically by the plugin.

## pnp.plugins.pull.fs.FileSystemWatcher

Watches the given directory for changes like created, moved, modified and deleted files. If `ignore_directories` is
set to False, then directories will be reported as well.

Per default will recursively report any file that is touched, changed or deleted in the given path. The
directory itself or subdirectories will be object to reporting too, if `ignore_directories` is set to False.

Requires extra `fswatcher`.

__Arguments__

- **path (str)**: The path to track for file / directory changes.
- **recursive (bool, optional)**: If set to True, any subfolders of the given path will be tracked too.
    Default is True.
- **patterns (str or list, optional)**: Any file pattern (e.g. *.txt or [*.txt, *.md].
    If set to None no filter is applied. Default is None.
- **ignore_patterns (str or list, optional)**: Any patterns to ignore (specify like argument `patterns`).
    If set to None, nothing will be ignored. Default is None.
- **ignore_directories (str, optional)**: If set to True will send events for directories when file change.
    Default is False.
- **case_sensitive (bool, optional)**: If set to True, any pattern is case_sensitive, otherwise it is case insensitive.
    Default is False.
- **events (str or list, optional)**: The events to track. One or multiple of 'moved', 'deleted', 'created'
    and/or 'modified'. If set to None all events will be reported. Default is None.
- **load_file (bool, optional)**: If set to True the file contents will be loaded into the result. Default is False.
- **mode (str, optional)**: Open mode of the file (only necessary when load_file is True). Can be text, binary or auto
    (guessing). Default is auto.
- **base64 (bool, optional)**: If set to True the loaded file contents will be converted to base64 (only applicable when
    load_file is True). Argument `mode` will be automatically set to 'binary'. Default is False.
- **defer_modified (float, optional)**: If set greater than 0, it will defer the sending of modified events for that
    amount of time (seconds). There might be multiple flushes of a file before it is written completely to disk.
    Without defer_modified each flush will raise a modified event. Default is 0.5.

__Result__

Example of an emitted message

```yaml
{
    'operation': 'modified',
    'source': '/tmp/abc.txt',
    'is_directory': False,
    'destination': None,  # Only non-None when operation = 'moved'
    'file': {  # Only present when load_file is True
        'file_name': 'abc.txt',
        'content': 'foo and bar',
        'read_mode': 'text',
        'base64': False
    }
}
```

__Examples__

```yaml
- name: file_watcher
  pull:
    plugin: pnp.plugins.pull.fs.FileSystemWatcher
    args:
      path: "/tmp"
      ignore_directories: true
      events: [created, deleted, modified]
      load_file: false
  push:
    plugin: pnp.plugins.push.simple.Echo

```
## pnp.plugins.pull.fs.Size

Periodically determines the size of the specified files or directories in bytes.

__Arguments__

- **paths (List of files/directories)**: List of files and/or directories to monitor their sizes in bytes.
- **fail_on_error (bool, optional)**: If set to true, the plugin will raise an error when a
    file/directory does not exists or any other file system related error occurs. Otherwise the plugin
    will proceed and simply report None as the file size. Set to True by default.

Hint: Be careful when adding directories with a large amount of files. This will be prettly slow cause
the plugin will iterate over each file and determine it's individual size.

__Result__

Example of an emitted message. Size is in bytes.

```yaml
{
  "logs": 32899586,
  "copy": 28912
}
```

__Examples__

```yaml
- name: file_size
  pull:
    plugin: pnp.plugins.pull.fs.Size
    args:
      instant_run: true
      interval: 5s
      fail_on_error: false
      paths:
        logs: /var/log  # directory - recursively determines size
        copy: /bin/cp  # file
  push:
    plugin: pnp.plugins.push.simple.Echo

```
## pnp.plugins.pull.ftp.Server

Runs a ftp server on the specified port to receive and send files by ftp protocol.
Optionally sets up a simple user/password authentication mechanism.


Requires extra `ftp`.

__Arguments__

- **directory (Optional[str])**: The directory to serve via ftp protocol. If not given a directory is created is created temporarily to accept incoming uploads.
- **port (Optional[int]]**: The port to listen on. If not specified the ftpserver will listen on `2121`.
- **user_pwd (Optional[Or(str, tuple)]**: User/password combination (as a tuple/list; see example). You may specify the user only - password will be empty OR you can enable anonymous access by not providing the argument.
- **events (Optional[List])**: A list of events to subscribe to. Available events are: connect, disconnect, login, logout, file_received, file_sent, file_received_incomplete, file_sent_incomplete. By default all events are subscribed.
- **max_cons (Optional[int])**: The maximum number of simultaneous connections the ftpserver will permit. Default is 256.
- **max_cons_ip (Optional[int])**: The maximum number of simultaneous connections from the same ip. Default is 5.

__Result__

All emitted messages will have an event field to identify the type of the event and an - optional - data field.
The data field will contain the user for login/logout events and the file_path for file-related events.

```yaml
{
  "event": "file_received",
  "data": {
    "file_path": "/private/tmp/ftp/test.txt"

## pnp.plugins.pull.gpio.Watcher

Listens for low/high state changes on the configured gpio pins.

In more detail the plugin can raise events when one of the following situations occur:

* rising (high) of a gpio pin - multiple events may occur in a short period of time
* falling (low) of a gpio pin - multiple events may occur in a short period of time
* switch of gpio pin - will suppress multiple events a defined period of time (bounce time)
* motion of gpio pin - will raise the event `motion_on` if the pin rises and set a timer with a configurable amount of
time. Any other gpio rising events will reset the timer. When the timer expires the `motion_off` event is raised.

Requires extra `gpio`.

__Arguments__

- **pins (list)**: The gpio pins to observe for state changes. Please see the examples section on how to configure it.
- **default (on of [rising, falling, switch, motion]**: The default edge that is applied when not configured. Please see the examples section for further details.

```yaml
- name: gpio
  pull:
    plugin: pnp.plugins.pull.gpio.Watcher
    args:
      default: rising
      pins:
        - 2               # No mode specified: Default mode (in this case 'rising')

## pnp.plugins.pull.hass.State

Connects to the `home assistant` websocket api and listens for state changes. If no `include` or `exclude` is defined
it will report all state changes. If `include` is defined only entities that match one of the specified patterns will
be emitted. If `exclude` if defined entities that match at least one of the specified patterns will be ignored. `exclude`
patterns overrides `include` patterns.


__Arguments__

- **host (str)**: Url to your `home assistant` instance (e.g. http://my-hass:8123)
- **token (str)**: Your long lived access token to access the websocket api. See below for further instructions
- **include (str or list[str])**: Patterns of entity state changes to include. All state changes that do not match the
defined patterns will be ignored</br>
- **exclude (str or list[str]**:Patterns of entity state changes to exclude. All state changes that do match the defined
patterns will be ignored

Hints:
* `include` and `exclude` support wildcards (e.g `*` and `?`)
* `exclude` overrides `include`. So you can `include` everything from a domain (`sensor.*`) but exclude individual entities.
* Create a long lived access token: [Home Assistant documentation](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/en/auth_api.html#long-lived-access-token)

__Result__

The emitted result always contains the `entity_id`, `new_state` and `old_state`:

```yaml
{
  'entity_id': 'light.bedroom_lamp',
  'old_state': {
    'state': 'off',

## pnp.plugins.pull.sensor.Sound

Listens to the microphone in realtime and searches the stream for specific sound patterns.
Practical example: I use this plugin to recognize my doorbell without tampering with the electrical device ;-)

Requires extra `sound`.

__Arguments__

- **wav_files (List[Dict])**: A list of dictionaries containing the configuration for each file that contains an original sound pattern to listen for.
The configuration consists of the following keys:
    * **path (str)**: The path to the original sound file. Absolute or relative to the pnp configuration file
    * **mode (Union[pearson,std], optional)**: Correlation/similarity method. Default is pearson. Try out which one is best for you
    * **offset (float, optional)**: Adjusts sensitivity for similarity
Positive means less sensitive; negative is more sensitive. You should try out 0.1 steps. Default is 0.0
    * **offset (dict, optional)**: Contains the cooldown configuration. Default is a cooldown period of 10 seconds and no emit of a cooldown event
        - **period (duration, optional)**: Prevents the pull to emit more than one sound detection event per cool down period. Default is 10 seconds
        - **emit_event (bool, optional)**: If set to true the end of the cooldown period will an emit as well. Default is false
- **device_index (int, optional)**: The index of the microphone device. Run `pnp_record_sound --list` to get the index.
If not specified pyAudio will try to find a capable device
- **ignore_overflow (bool, optional)**: If set to True any buffer overflows due to slow realtime processing will be ignored.
    Otherwise an exception will be thrown

Hints:
* You can list your available input devices: `pnp_record_sound --list`
* You can record a wav file from an input device: `pnp_record_sound <out.wav> <seconds_to_record> --index=<idx>`
* This one is _not_ pre-installed when using the docker image. Would be grateful if anyone can integrate it


__Result__

Will emit the event below when the correlation coefficient is above or equal the threshold.
In this case the component has detected a sound that is similar to one of the given sound patterns

```yaml
{
    "type": "sound"  # Type 'sound' means we detected a sound pattern
    "sound": ding,  # Name of the wav_file without path and extension. To differentiate if you have multiple patterns you listen to
    "corrcoef": 0.82,  # Correlation coefficient probably between [-1;+1] for pearson
    "threshold": 0.6  # Threshold influenced by sensitivity_offset
}
```

Will emit the event below when you have configured the component to send cooldown events as well.

```yaml
{
    "type": "cooldown"  # Type 'cooldown' means that we previously identified a sound pattern and the cooldown has happened
    "sound": ding,  # Name of the wav_file without path and extension. To differentiate if you have multiple patterns you listen to
}
```

__Examples__

```yaml
- name: sound_detector
  pull:
    plugin: pnp.plugins.pull.sensor.Sound
    args:
      wav_files:  # The files to compare for similarity
        - path: ding.wav  # Absolute or relative (from the config) path to the wav file
          mode: std  # Use std correlation coefficient [pearson, std]; optional default is pearson
          offset: -0.5  # Adjust sensitivity. Positive means less sensitive; negative is more sensitive. Default is 0.0
        - path: doorbell.wav  # This will use default values for mode and offset (pearson, 0.0)
          cooldown:
            period: 10s  # Prevents the pull to emit more than one sound detection event every 10 seconds
            emit_event: true  # Fire an event after the actual cool down - Useful for binary_sensors to return to their 'off' state
      device_index:  # The index of the microphone devices. If not specified pyAudio will try to find a capable device
      ignore_overflow: true  # Some devices might be too slow to process the stream in realtime. Ignore any buffer overflow errors.
  push:
    - plugin: pnp.plugins.push.simple.Echo

```
## pnp.plugins.pull.simple.Count

- name: deutschebahn
  pull:
    plugin: pnp.plugins.pull.traffic.DeutscheBahn
    args:
      origin: Hamburg Hbf
      destination: München Hbf
      only_direct: true  # Only show direct transfers wo change. Default is False.
      instant_run: true
      interval: 1m
  push:
    plugin: pnp.plugins.push.simple.Echo

```
## pnp.plugins.pull.trigger.Web

Wraps a poll-based pull and provides a rest-endpoint to externally trigger the poll action.
This will disable the cron-like / scheduling features of the polling component and simply
provides you an interface to call the component anytime you see fit.

__Arguments__

- **poll (Polling component)**: The polling component that you want to trigger externally. See example for configuration.
- **port (int)**: The port for the server to listen on.
- **endpoint (str, optional)**: The name of the endpoint. Default is `/trigger`.

Assume you set `port = 8080` and `endpoint = trigger` then your corresponding `curl` command
to trigger the polling externally would look like this:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/trigger
```

In case of success you get back a `200`. In case of error it's a `500`.

__Result__

The component will simply forward the result of the underlying component to dependent pushes.

__Examples__

```yaml
engine: !engine
  type: pnp.engines.AsyncEngine
  retry_handler: !retry
    type: pnp.engines.NoRetryHandler
tasks:
  - name: trigger_web
    pull:
      plugin: pnp.plugins.pull.trigger.Web
      args:
        port: 8080
        endpoint: '/'
        poll:
          plugin: pnp.plugins.pull.monitor.Stats
    push:
      plugin: pnp.plugins.push.simple.Echo

```

Test it out:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/
```

```yaml
- name: trigger_web
  pull:
    plugin: pnp.plugins.pull.trigger.Web
    args:
      port: 8080
      poll:
        plugin: pnp.plugins.pull.traffic.DeutscheBahn
        args:
          origin: Hamburg Hbf
          destination: München Hbf
          only_direct: true  # Only show direct transfers wo change. Default is False.
  push:
    plugin: pnp.plugins.push.simple.Echo

```

Test it out:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/trigger
```
## pnp.plugins.pull.zway.ZwayPoll

Pulls the specified json content from the zway rest api. The content is specified by the url, e.g.
`http://<host>:8083/ZWaveAPI/Run/devices` will pull all devices and serve the result as a json.

Specify the polling interval by setting the argument `interval`. User / password combination is required when
your api is protected against guest access (by default it is).

Use multiple pushes and the related selectors to extract the required content like temperature readings (see
the examples section for guidance).

__Arguments__

- **url (str)**: The url to poll periodically.
- **user (str)**: Authentication user name.
- **password (str)**: Authentication password.
- **interval (polling literal, optional)**: Polling interval (default: 1m).

All arguments (`url`, `user` and `password`) can be automatically injected via environment variables.
* ZWAY_URL
* ZWAY_USER
* ZWAY_PASSWORD

__Result__

Emits the content of the fetched url as it is.

__Examples__

```yaml
## Please make sure to adjust url and device ids
## Username and Password are injected from environment variables:
##     export ZWAY_USER=admin
##     export ZWAY_PASSWORD=secret_one
- name: zway
  pull:
    plugin: pnp.plugins.pull.zway.ZwayPoll
    args:
      url: "http://smarthome:8083/ZWaveAPI/Run/devices"
      interval: 5s
  push:
    - plugin: pnp.plugins.push.simple.Echo
      # Temperature of fibaro motion sensor
      # You can access the returned json like you would inquire the zway-api
      selector: payload[19].instances[0].commandClasses[49].data[1].val.value
    - plugin: pnp.plugins.push.simple.Echo
      # Luminiscence of fibaro motion sensor
      selector: payload[19].instances[0].commandClasses[49].data[3].val.value

```

__Appendix__

Below are some common selector examples to fetch various metrics from various devices

- **Fibaro Motion Sensor**
* Temperature
`payload[deviceid].instances[0].commandClasses[49].data[1].val.value`
* Luminescence
`payload[deviceid].instances[0].commandClasses[49].data[3].val.value`

- **fibaro Wallplug**
* Meter
`payload[deviceid].instances[0].commandClasses[50].data[0].val.value`

- **Thermostat (Danfoss / other should work as well)**
* Setpoint
`payload[deviceid].instances[0].commandClasses[67].data[1].val.value`

- **Battery operated devices**
* Battery level
`payload[deviceid].instances[0].commandClasses[128].data.last.value`

## pnp.plugins.pull.zway.ZwayReceiver

Setups a http server to process incoming GET-requests from the Zway-App [`HttpGet`](https://github.com/hplato/Zway-HTTPGet/blob/master/index.js).

__Arguments__

- **url_format (str)**: The url_format that is configured in your HttpGet App. If you configured
`http://<ip>:<port>/set?device=%DEVICE%&state=%VALUE%` (default of the App), you basically have to copy the path
component `set?device=%DEVICE%&state=%VALUE%` to be your `url_format`.
- **mode ([mapping, auto, both])**: If set to `mapping` (default) you should provide the `device_mapping` to manually map your virtual devices.
If set to `auto` the plugin will try to determine the device_id, command class, mode and the type on it's own. If set to `both` the plugin
will first try the `device_mapping` and then perform the auto-magic.</br>
- **device_mapping (Or(Dict[Str, Str], Dict[Str, Dict]), optional)**: A mapping to map the somewhat cryptic virtual device names to
human readable ones. Default is None, which means that no mapping will be performed. Two ways possible:
1. Ordinary mapping from virtual device name -> alias.
2. Enhanced mapping from virtual device name to dictionary with additional properties. One property has to be alias.
- **ignore_unknown_devices (bool, optional)**: If set to True all incoming requests that are associated with an device
that is not part of the mapping or - when mode = [auto, both] - cannot be auto mapped will be ignored. Default is False.

Additionally the component will accept any arguments that `pnp.plugins.pull.http.Server` would accept.

__Result__

Given the url_format `set?%DEVICE%&value=%VALUE%`, the url `http://<ip>:<port>/set?vdevice1&value=5.5` and
the device_mapping `vdevice1 -> alias of vdevice1` the emitted message will look like this:

```yaml
{
    'device_name': 'alias of vdevice1',
    'raw_device': 'vdevice1'
    'value': '5.5',
    'props': {}
}
```

When `mode` is `auto` or `both` the plugin will try to determine the device id and the type of the virtual device on it's
own. Given the virtual device name `ZWayVDev_zway_7-0-48-1` and the value of `on` will produce the following:

```yaml
{
    'device_name': '7',
    'raw_device': 'ZWayVDev_zway_7-0-48-1',
    'value': 'on'
    'props': {
        'command_class': '48',
        'mode': '1',
        'type': 'motion'
    }
}
```

__Examples__

```yaml
- name: zway_receiver
  pull:
    plugin: pnp.plugins.pull.zway.ZwayReceiver
    args:
      port: 5000
      mode: mapping  # mapping, auto or both
      device_mapping:
        vdevice1:  # Props = {type: motion}
          alias: dev1
          type: motion
        vdevice2:  # Props = {type: switch, other_prop: foo}
          alias: dev2
          type: switch
          other_prop: foo
        vdevice3: dev3  # props == {}
      url_format: "%DEVICE%?value=%VALUE%"
      ignore_unknown_devices: false
  push:
    - plugin: pnp.plugins.push.simple.Echo
      selector: "'Got value {} from device {} ({}) with props {}'.format(data.value, data.device_name, data.raw_device, data.props)"

```
