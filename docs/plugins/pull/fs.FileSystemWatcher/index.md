# pnp.plugins.pull.fs.FileSystemWatcher

Watches the given directory for changes like created, moved, modified and deleted files. If `ignore_directories` is
set to False, then directories will be reported as well.

Per default will recursively report any file that is touched, changed or deleted in the given path. The
directory itself or subdirectories will be object to reporting too, if `ignore_directories` is set to False.

Requires extra `fswatcher`.

__Arguments__

- **path (str)**: The path to track for file / directory changes.
- **recursive (bool, optional)**: If set to True, any subfolders of the given path will be tracked too.
    Default is True.
- **patterns (str or list, optional)**: Any file pattern (e.g. *.txt or [*.txt, *.md].
    If set to None no filter is applied. Default is None.
- **ignore_patterns (str or list, optional)**: Any patterns to ignore (specify like argument `patterns`).
    If set to None, nothing will be ignored. Default is None.
- **ignore_directories (str, optional)**: If set to True will send events for directories when file change.
    Default is False.
- **case_sensitive (bool, optional)**: If set to True, any pattern is case_sensitive, otherwise it is case insensitive.
    Default is False.
- **events (str or list, optional)**: The events to track. One or multiple of 'moved', 'deleted', 'created'
    and/or 'modified'. If set to None all events will be reported. Default is None.
- **load_file (bool, optional)**: If set to True the file contents will be loaded into the result. Default is False.
- **mode (str, optional)**: Open mode of the file (only necessary when load_file is True). Can be text, binary or auto
    (guessing). Default is auto.
- **base64 (bool, optional)**: If set to True the loaded file contents will be converted to base64 (only applicable when
    load_file is True). Argument `mode` will be automatically set to 'binary'. Default is False.
- **defer_modified (float, optional)**: If set greater than 0, it will defer the sending of modified events for that
    amount of time (seconds). There might be multiple flushes of a file before it is written completely to disk.
    Without defer_modified each flush will raise a modified event. Default is 0.5.

Example of an emitted message

```yaml
{
    'operation': 'modified',
    'source': '/tmp/abc.txt',
    'is_directory': False,
    'destination': None,  # Only non-None when operation = 'moved'
    'file': {  # Only present when load_file is True
        'file_name': 'abc.txt',
        'content': 'foo and bar',
        'read_mode': 'text',
        'base64': False
    }
}
```
